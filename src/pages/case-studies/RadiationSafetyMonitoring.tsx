  clientBackground:
    "The client operates in a regulated environment where radiation exposure must be continuously monitored to ensure safety and compliance. The setup involved controlled areas where accurate measurement, reliable data logging, and timely alerts were critical to protect personnel and maintain operational standards. Due to the nature of the environment, system reliability and data integrity were key requirements.",
  challenge: {
    description:
      "The client relied on standalone or manual radiation measurement methods, which provided limited visibility and delayed awareness of abnormal exposure levels. Data was often reviewed retrospectively, making it difficult to respond proactively to potential safety risks.",
    points: [
      "Lack of continuous radiation monitoring",
      "No centralised visibility of radiation levels",
      "Limited alerting for threshold breaches",
      "Difficulty maintaining structured historical records for compliance",
    ],
    summary:
      "The client required a solution that could deliver continuous monitoring, centralised oversight, and reliable reporting.",

  implementation: {
    description:
      "The deployment was executed in a controlled manner to ensure safety and accuracy.",
    points: [
      "Sensors were installed and calibrated according to operational standards",
      "Alert thresholds were configured based on acceptable exposure limits",
      "Continuous monitoring was validated under real operating conditions",
      "Reporting views were aligned with compliance and audit needs",
    ],
    summary:
      "This approach ensured that the system met both operational and safety requirements.",
